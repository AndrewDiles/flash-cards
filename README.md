# Flash Cards

## Intent

- Building a small app to help a friend's daughter learn her multiplication tables with a timed element (similar to how she is tested).
- Decided to use Typescript.
- Generally avoided exterior packages.
- Considering page flip animations, though I suspect they will harm the intent or the exercise and slow the pace of learning.
